					<h2>Accessibility - Service Design Barriers</h2>
					<p>by Julianna Rowsell</p>

				</section>

				<!-- SLIDE -->
				<section>
					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Julianna</strong>. I work on helping the Canadian Digital Service create accessible and inclusive services for Canadians.

					<h2>What is my role?</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>What is accessibility? It is barrier free access, it empowers people. My role isn't limited to web components, applications and interactions. Accessibility crosses sectors and teams. We need to be inclusive when we interact and provide services to people online and offline.</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Service design barriers: an inclusive overview</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							This talk will cover key findings from the Service Design Barriers Panel that CDS hosted in January 2019 with persons with disabilities. We are hoping to share back what we have learned with the community and hope to continue keeping the conversations going.
						</p>
					</ul>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Who did we talk to?</h2>
						<p>We talked to public servants who have disabilities. We spoke to participants with motor, vision, hearing, neurodiversity and invisible disabillities.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Motor: 1 participant</li>
						<li>Vision: 2 participants</li>
						<li>Hearing: 1 participant</li>
						<li>Neurodiversity: 1 participant</li>
						<li>Invisible: 1 participant</li>


				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why did we talk to them?</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>We wanted to better understand the barriers that people with diverse needs had with service design. Having coversations with persons with disabilities is a great way to start developing an understanding of their experiences and can inform design and development of products and services.</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Motor</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>Wheel chair user with limited gross and fine motor skills. This particpant uses a keyboard, sticky keys, switchs and onscreen keyboard overlays to interact with digital products and services</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Vision</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>We had two participants with vision related disabilities. One was blind from birth and used braille and a screen reader to better orient themselves. The second lost their vision as an adult and mostly used a screen reader to interact with digital products and services</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Hearing</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>This participant had hearing loss and is considered deafened. They use a bone conducting hearing aid. They also utilize CART and LSQ (French Sign Language).</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Neurodiversity</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>This participant is dyslexic and was diagnosed as a child.</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Invisible</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>This participant has an auto immune disorder that affects flexibility and mobility and is pain related.</p>
					</ul>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>What did we learn?</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>We are going to go through the notes on the whiteboard.</p>
					</ul>

				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Let's think about this for a moment</h2>
			
						<p>Does this align with your assumptions?</p>

				</section>

								<section>
					<h2>Questions?</h2>
					<p>Lets <strong>start</strong> a conversation</p>
				</section>

				<!-- SLIDE -->
				<section>
					<h2>The government of Canada can be a leader in accessibility and inclusive design</h2>
					
				</section>

				<!-- SLIDE -->
				<section>
					<h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
					
						<p>Inclusive Design is design that considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference.</p>
					
				</section>

				<!-- SLIDE -->
					<section>
						<h2>Accessibility</h2>
						<p>Disability is the mismatch between the needs and preferences of the user and the system or environment. 

						Accessibility is the ability of the system of environment to accommodate the needs and preferences of the individual.<p>
						

					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Are the Government of Canada’s products and services required to be accessible? </h2>
					</section>

				<!-- SLIDE -->
				<section>
					<h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Outlines best practices for making web content universally perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</li>
							<li>Defines criteria for successful inclusive web design, with ascending levels of compliance (levels A, AA, and AAA).</li> 
							<li>Is composed and reviewed by a global community of digital experts.</li> 
							<li>Connects the world through common information technology and user experience standards.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
						<h2>Principles of WCAG 2.1</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-left"><strong>Perceivable</strong> – Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-left"><strong>Operable</strong> – User interface components and navigation must be operable</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-left"><strong>Understandable</strong> – Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-left"><strong>Robust</strong> – Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Meeting government accessibility requirements</h2>
					<p>Digital products and services in the Government of Canada must meet WCAG 2.0 AA. CDS has adopted and is striving to meet WCAG 2.1 AA. (Released in June 2018 and already adopted officially by the UK, Australia and Japan.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Globally 1-5 people have a disability</h2>
					<p>Build for all users, with different needs at different times in different circumstances.

						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Accessibility is about making sure your service can be used by as many people as possible.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Accessibility doesn’t have to be overwhelming</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Build accessibility into the beginning of a product. Not only will it save time, but also resources.</li>
						<li>Shorten update/release change process by clearing hurdles and lengthy approvals.</li>
						<li>Reach out and include persons with disabilities throughout product discovery, design, development, and delivery phases.</li>
						<li>Build awareness on the product teams in order to improve the service. Encourage delivery team members to engage within the community, being open to feedback and striving to make things better.</li>
						<li>Embed accessibility champions on product teams in different roles to improve reach, awareness, and understanding of accessibility issues.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Start considering accessibility early</h2>
					<img src="img/discovery.jpg" alt= "discovery, alpha, beta, live">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What can we plan to do to help improve the human experience of digital services?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Route Map for Accessibility</h2>
					<p>Our route map for accessibility:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Do design research with people</li>
							<li>Include persons with disabilities throughout the process</li>
							<li>Be pragmatic, go forward with accessibility in mind, take corrective measures as needed</li>
							<li>Build capacity in inclusive practices</li>
							<li>Prioritize change, consider impact, reach, modernization, requests/analytics, and feasibility</li>
							<li>Assign budget (it’s necessary, worthwhile, and the law)</li>
							<li>Tap into expertise across government</li>
							<li>Plan for continued progressive improvement</li>
							<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Make it better than it was yesterday.

					<h2>Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility</h2>
					<p>Accessibility is multidisciplinary</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Content creator (client/partner)</li>
						<li>Designer</li>
						<li>Developer</li>
						<li>User Researcher</li>
						<li>Product Manager</li>
						<li>Policy</li> 
						<li>SME’s</li>
					</ul> 
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>The usual approach to accessibility is a problem</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>No one thinks about accessibility...except the accessibility expert.</li>
						<li>Accessibility comes at the end of development...by testing done by the accessibility expert.</li>
						<li>All issues found are directed to developers to fix...with help from the accessibility expert.</li> 

						<p>Result: “Sort of” accessibility + $$$ and time.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How to make an existing content or service accessible</h2>
					<ul> 
						<li>Make accessibility part of your design research</li>
						<li>Test with users with diverse needs</li> 
						<li>Use automated testing tools</li>
						<li>Hire an accessibility subject matter expert to give you advice</li>
						<li>Test your product or service manually for accessibility</li>
						<li>Conduct an accessibility audit</li>
						<li>Make the required fixes</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Accessibility Misunderstanding</h2>
					<p>Like usability, accessibility should be built in at the start. It’s poorly functioning as an afterthought. We cannot <strong>bolt</strong> on accessibility and expect accessible products and services.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why is accessibility hard?</h2>
					<p>Little design choices made without understanding accessibility issues and criteria - they add up and lead to inaccessible services.<p>

					<h3>How do we do better?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Research guidelines</li>
							<li>Ask Questions</li>
							<li>Follow the answers</li>
							<li>Analyse the results</li>
							<li>Repeat until insight</li>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Possible solutions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Champion accessibility</li>
						<li>Everyone works towards it</li>
						<li>Education on how choices impact accessibility</li>
						<li>Utilize existing expertise of team members</li>
					</ul>

						<strong>Goal</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Maximize accessibility expertise</li>
						<li>Reduce time required to deliver accessible products</li>
						<li>Prevent issues before they happen</li>
						<li>Identify and resolve early</li>
						<li>Improve overall accessibility and strive to exceed</li>
